# Anomaly detection

## Overview

Anomaly detection asks whether collider data contains something the Standard Model
does not predict, without specifying in advance what that something is. It responds to
a structural tension in the search program: a dedicated search is far more sensitive
to the signal it was designed for, but the space of possible signals is vastly larger
than the number of searches anyone can perform.

The literature divides by how much supervision is available, and that distinction
matters more than the choice of architecture. *Unsupervised* methods flag events
improbable under a learned model of the data. *Weakly supervised* methods exploit the
expectation that a signal is localized in some variable, so a classifier separating a
signal region from sidebands approximates the optimal discriminant without ever seeing
a labeled signal. The latter has proven substantially more powerful.

A point easily missed on a first pass: the hard part is usually not the anomaly score
but the background estimate, since a selection made with a learned score distorts the
background in ways that must be controlled before any significance can be quoted.

## Curated paper list

!!! note "This list is a seed, not a curated selection"
    A few landmark papers are listed to give the section a starting shape.
    A proper curated list — thematically grouped, with an annotation on every
    entry — is what this section still needs. See [Contribute](../contribute.md).

## Open questions

*What is settled here, what is contested, and what remains unsolved? This is
the part a bibliography structurally cannot provide, and often the most
useful paragraph on the page.*

## Further reading

*Relevant work that is not an entry point — too specialized, too recent, or simply not where a newcomer should start. Suggestions that do not fit the curated list above belong here rather than being turned away.*

*Nothing listed yet.*
